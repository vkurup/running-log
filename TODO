Make sure metric conversion formulas are accurate.

If user selects a course, automatically fill-in distance (need javascript)

If user selects 'Other' for course or type, then show text field (javascript).

Allow user to view checked workouts.

I'm not going to use cr_keywords because I don't see an advantage. I want
